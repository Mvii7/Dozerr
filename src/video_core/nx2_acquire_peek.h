// EDEN_NX2_ACQUIRE_PEEK (puller.cpp): a Switch 2 semaphore acquire whose value guest memory
// already holds goes on without draining the split GPU thread's back. What the puller decides
// with, kept apart from it so it can be tested.
//
// Why a met word needs no drain: the back (and its stages) runs everything the front sent in
// order, so the work after the acquire runs after all the work sent before it either way. The
// drain only adds the writes still queued (or held by the caches) to what the acquire reads.
// The word in memory was written by a release the back already ran, and the work before that
// release ran before it; queued writes of other channels are not ordered before this acquire on
// the console either. What would change the answer is a write of this channel's own, sent before
// the acquire and not run yet, that takes a met value back: a counter that only goes up never
// does. The puller's releases are noted, the engines' (3D report semaphores, compute and DMA
// releases) are not seen on the front. So only acquires that behave like waits on such a counter
// skip (Decide): no mask acquires (flag bits are cleared again); no word seen going down; and
// each skip waits for more than the channel's last met acquire on the word did. A flag or a
// counter reset between rounds waits for the same or a lower value again, and keeps the drain,
// whose read then sees the reset. No queued release of the puller's on this channel that would
// not meet the acquire either.
